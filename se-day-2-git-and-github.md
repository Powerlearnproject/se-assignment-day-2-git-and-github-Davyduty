1.Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows developers to collaborate efficiently, manage different versions of their projects, and revert to previous states if necessary.

Key Concepts of Version Control:

Repository: A central database that stores all versions of files in a project.
Commit: A snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.
Branch: A separate line of development that diverges from the main project.
Merge: The process of combining changes from one branch into another.
Checkout: The process of switching between different versions or branches.
Why GitHub is Popular

GitHub is a popular platform for hosting and managing Git repositories. It offers a range of features that make it a powerful tool for developers:

Centralized Repository: It provides a centralized location for storing and managing code.
Collaboration: It allows developers to collaborate on projects by sharing code, reviewing changes, and working on different branches.
Version History: It keeps track of all changes to the code, making it easy to revert to previous versions or compare different versions.
Issue Tracking: It provides tools for managing and tracking issues and bugs.
Pull Requests: It facilitates a review process for code changes before they are merged into the main project.

How Version Control Maintains Project Integrity
Undoing Mistakes: If a developer introduces a bug or makes a mistake, they can easily revert to a previous version of the code.
Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Â  
Experimentation: Developers can experiment with new features or code changes on separate branches without affecting the main project.
Code Review: Code reviews can be performed on specific changes, ensuring code quality and consistency.
Security: Version control systems can help track and manage security vulnerabilities by identifying and fixing them quickly.
